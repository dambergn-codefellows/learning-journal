# Week 1

The thing I learned this week is a bit more about the work flow in github when dealing with forking projects.  Still going through some learning curves with it but it is getting there.  Honestly still not a fan of github, I hope that changes soon because I do see the benefit of it.

Another thing I learned is the difference between jquery.js and jquery-min.js
