# learning-journal

Today I Learned...
One of the most effective tools in adult learning is reflection. By writing coherent summaries of lessons learned, we cement that learning and deepen our understanding of a subject. It also helps us to measure our progress.

Tasks
Every day you will have an assignment to write an entry in your learning journal about some lesson you learned that day or in recent days. Your entry may contain code samples, links to additional resources you found, or anything else you feel is relevant. Your entry may also contain whatever thoughts and feelings you had about the class or your own studies. This is YOUR journal, so don't worry about being proper or fulfilling some quota. Let it express you.

There is a correlation between students who write consistently in their journals, and students who succeed in class. Take this assignment seriously.

IF YOU DON'T ALREADY HAVE ONE: Create a directory in your codefellows directory called learning-journal
Create a Markdown file for that day, e.g. "LJ-code301-day1.md"
At the end of the day, write to your heart's content. Write about what you learned, what may or may not have happened in group work, what you're hoping for, etc. This is for your own reflection more than it is just another assessment instrument.
Submitting Your Work

Turn this directory into a Git repository and push it to GitHub. Find the link to the file for this specific entry and submit that link to Canvas.
